### Mandatory Tasks

***0. Write a Bash script that takes in a URL, sends a request to that URL, and displays the size of the body of the response***

	* The size must be displayed in bytes
	* Use curl

***1. Write a Bash script that takes in a URL, sends a GET request to the URL, and displays the body of the response***

	* Display only body of a 200 status code response
	* Use curl

***2. Write a Bash script that sends a DELETE request to the URL passed as the first argument and displays the body of the response***

	* Use curl

***3. Write a Bash script that takes in a URL and displays all HTTP methods the server will accept.***

	* Use curl

***4. Write a Bash script that takes in a URL as an argument, sends a GET request to the URL, and displays the body of the response***

	* A header variable X-School-User-Id must be sent with the value 98
	* Use curl

***5. Write a Bash script that takes in a URL, sends a POST request to the passed URL, and displays the body of the response***

	* A variable email must be sent with the value test@gmail.com
	* A variable subject must be sent with the value I will always be here for PLD
	* Use curl

***6. Write a function that finds a peak in a list of unsorted integers.***

	* Prototype: def find_peak(list_of_integers):
	* Don't import any module
	* The algorithm must have the lowest complexity (no need to go through all numbers to find a peak)
	* 6-peak.py must contain the function
	* 6-peak.txt must contain the complexity of your algorithm: O(log(n)), O(n), O(nlog(n)) or O(n2)
	* (there may be more than one peak in the list)

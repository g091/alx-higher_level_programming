# JavaScript - Warm up README.

## Mandatory Tasks

***0. Script that prints “JavaScript is amazing”:***

- You must create a constant variable called myVar with the value “JavaScript is amazing”
- You must use console.log(...) to print all output
- No use of var

***1. Script that prints 3 lines:***

- The first line: “C is fun”
- The second line: “Python is cool”
- The third line: “JavaScript is amazing”
- You must use console.log(...) to print all output
- No use of var

***2. Script that prints a message depending of the number of arguments passed:***

- If no arguments are passed to the script, print “No argument”
- If only one argument is passed to the script, print “Argument found”
- Otherwise, print “Arguments found”
- You must use console.log(...) to print all output
- No use of var

***3. Script that prints the first argument passed to it:***

- If no arguments are passed to the script, print “No argument”
- You must use console.log(...) to print all output
- No use of var
- No use of length

***4. Script that prints two arguments passed to it, in the following format: “ is ”***

- You must use console.log(...) to print all output
- No use of var

***5. Script that prints My number: <first argument converted in integer> if the first argument can be converted to an integer:***

- If the argument can’t be converted to an integer, print “Not a number”
- You must use console.log(...) to print all output
- No use of var
- No use of try/catch

***6. Script that prints 3 lines: (like 1-multi_languages.js) but by using an array of string and a loop***

- The first line: “C is fun”
- The second line: “Python is cool”
- The third line: “JavaScript is amazing”
- You must use console.log(...) to print all output
- No use of var
- No use of any if/else statement
- You can use only one console.log
- You must use a loop (while, for, etc.)

***7. Script that prints x times “C is fun”***

- Where x is the first argument of the script
- If the first argument can’t be converted to an integer, print “Missing number of occurrences”
- You must use console.log(...) to print all output
- No use of var
- You can use only two console.log
- You must use a loop (while, for, etc.)

***8. Script that prints a square***

- The first argument is the size of the square
- If the first argument can’t be converted to an integer, print “Missing size”
- You must use the character X to print the square
- You must use console.log(...) to print all output
- No use of var
- You must use a loop (while, for, etc.)

***9. Script that prints the addition of 2 integers***

- The first argument is the first integer
- The second argument is the second integer
- You have to define a function with this prototype: function add(a, b)
- You must use console.log(...) to print all output
- No use of var

***10. Script that computes and prints a factorial***

- The first argument is integer (argument can be cast as integer) used for computing the factorial
- Factorial of NaN is 1
- You must do it recursively
- You must use a function
- You must use console.log(...) to print all output
- No use of var

***11. Script that searches the second biggest integer in the list of arguments.***

- You can assume all arguments can be converted to integer
- If no argument passed, print 0
- If the number of arguments is 1, print 0
- You must use console.log(...) to print all output
- No use of var

***12. Update this script to replace the value 12 with 89:***

- No use of var

***13. Function that returns the addition of 2 integers***

- The function must be visible from outside
- The name of the function must be add
- No use of var

## Advanced Tasks

***14. Write a file that modifies the value of myVar to 333***

***15. Function that executes x times a function.***

- The function must be visible from outside
- Prototype: function (x, theFunction)
- No use of var

***16. Function that increments and calls a function.***

- The function must be visible from outside
- Prototype: function (number, theFunction)

***17. Update this script by adding a new function incr that increments the integer value.***

- No use of var
